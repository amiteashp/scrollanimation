                OK Don't get mad, but have you ever considered that we might be part 
                of a simulation?

                Ugh! This again! What do you mean, that we were created by some 
                higher interdimensional being? What next, are we some sort of
                demonstration for an alien's homework?

                Hey hey! No need to get so confrontational. I was merely speculating.
                Like you said, it's nearly impossible.
            </p>

                Good. Now that that's resolved. Let's discuss something more grounded
                in reality.
